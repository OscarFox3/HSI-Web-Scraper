## FGCU Senior Project
### Team members: Diego Grisales, Oscar Fox, Ragy Costa De Jesus.
The project consists of an open-source desktop application that scrapes specific web pages in search for posts containing 
keywords that have been linked to human trafficking. Posts are categorized based on the number of keywords found within the post. 
The goal of the software is to provide HSI agents with leads to human trafficking posts which will include all the information in 
the post along with a screenshot.
